__At the time of this commit, these instructions are incomplete and I haven't worked all the bugs out of the configurations. Until this notice is removed, proceed with caution.__

# Introduction
I started down this path to synchronize my standard dotfiles across my UNIX-like computers, which are macOS and raspbian based. I've spent quite a bit of time tuning these to my liking, and they reflect my particular set of interests (i.e. I do much of my programming in Python and not much in other languages, so my vim configurations reflect this).

For a list of the plugins installed and/or used by these dotfiles, you can [find them here](whats_included.md).

## Documentation
Of particular note, I have remapped my keyboard layout via Karabiner configs to swap the escape and caps-lock keys since I use Vim so much. If you use your caps-lock more often than your escape key, there is a profile named "Vanilla Profile" with the normal layout. If you have a layout you find useful, please feel free to submit a pull request to add it to the repo.

Besides the documentation for each module/plugin I've used and for ZSH itself, which can be found in the repositories for the respective software and thus I won't duplicate here, I've been [compiling a cheatsheet of Vim commands/key mappings](vim-cheatsheet.md) for the various Vim plugins.
